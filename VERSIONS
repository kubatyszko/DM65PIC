(WORK-IN-PROGRESS, NOT RELEASED YET) Revision #2 (dm65pic-firmware-rev2.hex) 10/xx/2015

* Added support for standard Commodore 64 keyboards.

WIP, TODO * Added support for the power and drive led.

* Swapped the joystick ports so that they are correct when the FPGA and the
  DM65PIC are being put into the MEGA65 body case.

* If any key on a Commodore 64 keyboard is pressed, then the firmware assumes
  that the DM65PIC is not located inside a MEGA65 body case and therefore
  the joystick ports are swapped back, so that they are correct, when being
  put into a Commodore 64 body case.

Revision #1 (dm65pic-firmware-rev1.hex) 9/27/2015

First working version: Supports the original Commodore 65 prototype keyboard
and joysticks at port #1 and #2.
