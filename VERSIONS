Revision #3 (dm65pic-firmware-rev3.hex) 10/06/2015

* Inverted the logic of the power and FDD LEDs: the firmware pulls the lines
  now to GND, if we want the LEDs to be ON. Reason: The original Commodore 65
  prototype keyboard has a very strange 12V LED circuit, which cannot be
  driven by the STM32 on the DM65PIC, so we needed to do some hardware hacks.
  This firmware revision is compatible with these hardware hacks.

  You might want to stick to firmware revision #2, if you're keyboard has
  LEDs that behave "normally" or if you just don't care about the LEDs.

Revision #2 (dm65pic-firmware-rev2.hex) 10/04/2015

* Added support for standard Commodore 64 keyboards.

* Added support for the power and floppy disk drive (FDD) LEDs.

* Swapped the joystick ports so that they are correct when the FPGA and the
  DM65PIC are being put into the MEGA65 body case.

* If any key on a Commodore 64 keyboard is pressed, then the firmware assumes
  that the DM65PIC is not located inside a MEGA65 body case and therefore
  the joystick ports are swapped back, so that they are correct, when being
  put into a Commodore 64 body case.

Revision #1 (dm65pic-firmware-rev1.hex) 9/27/2015

First working version: Supports the original Commodore 65 prototype keyboard
and joysticks at port #1 and #2.
